We’ll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to
log the topics they’re interested in and to make journal entries
as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page
should describe the site and invite users to either register or log
in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics,
add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.
